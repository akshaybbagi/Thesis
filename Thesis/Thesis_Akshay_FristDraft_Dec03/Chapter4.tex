\section{Flow field analysis}
Before injecting the logs, the flow field was analyzed. The flow field was simulated in STAR-CCM+ with DEM model turned off. Other flow field settings have been mentioned in Chapter \ref{Chapter3}. Water flow was simulated for 20 s of physical time.\\ 
The velocity magnitude contour on a section that passes through center of submerged part of RDDP is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Vel_Mag_middle}. The flow accelerates around RDDP sweep. Water that is going below the sweep emerges behind it. There is a flow separation region behind the sweep and the pontoons. The velocity recovers behind the sweep. Corresponding pressure field is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Pressure_middle}. There is a stagnation point right in front of the RDDP sweep as expected. Water is brought to complete stop here.\\ 
Vortices are shed from this region as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Vorticity_image}. Vorticity can also be seen along RDDP pontoons. There is a boundary layer developed on RDDP pontoons because of the no-slip wall boundary condition. This is the region where periodic vortices are being shed. The vortices diffuse far behind RDDP. Fast-Fourier transform of the velocity signal behind RDDP gives vortex shedding frequency of 0.6 Hz as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fft}. Vortices are being shed at every 1.6667 s.

\noindent Presence of vortices can also be seen from streamlines around RDDP as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Streamlines_middle_sideview}. The streamlines are originating from points on a section that passes through the center of RDDP. The streamlines are colored by velocity magnitude. Water at this level goes below the RDDP pontoons and starts to swirl up. Figure \ref{fig:Streamlines_middle_ISO} shows the same at an angle. Swirling up of water can be clearly seen. Figure \ref{fig:Streamlines_middle} shows the top view of the streamlines. \\

\noindent Flow field near RDDP very close to top of the domain is slightly different from that at the middle of RDDP. Water doesn't tend to go below RDDP pontoons and curl up. The streamlines can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:Streamlines_top_sideview}. Water accelerates around the sweep and then flows along the pontoons as seen in Figure \ref{fig:Streamlines_top}.

\noindent Streamlines around an iso-surface of RDDP is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Streamlines_isosurface}. This iso-surface of RDDP is just a projection of RDDP at 0.05 m wall distance. This is not an actual surface. Water flows around the pontoons and occasionally goes below. A recirculation zone can be seen at the bottom of RDDP. Water recirculates there and then emerges from behind the sweep.\\

\section{Analysis of impact of logs on RDDP}
Impact of logs (debris) on RDDP is now studied by turning on DEM settings on STAR-CCM+. Two sizes of logs (maintaining volume constant) are used for analysis. The lengths are 1 m and 2 m. For simplicity the lengths have been non-dimensionalized by diving the lengths with 2 m. The two cases now become 0.5L (1 m case) and 1L (2 m case). In addition to changing the log lengths, the flow velocity has also been varied in order: 0.5 m/s, 1 m/s and 2 m/s. Analysis is done for six combinations of log lengths and flow velocities as show in Table. Effects of log sizes and flow velocities on the forces on RDDP are studied.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Six combinations of log sizes and flow velocities of the analysis}
\label{case combination}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
V = 0.5 m/s, Size: 0.5L & V = 0.5 m/s, Size: 1L \\ \hline
V = 1.0 m/s, Size: 0.5L & V = 1.0 m/s, Size: 1L \\ \hline
V = 2.0 m/s, Size: 0.5L & V = 2.0 m/s, Size: 1L \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The logs are injected into the flow from fifteen locations upstream of RDDP as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Log_Positions}. These logs are of Size 1L. The numbering is to identify the log injection positions. The color scale shows the distance of centroids of the logs from front end of RDDP sweep. Henceforth, the logs will be numbered according to their injection position numbers as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Log_Positions}. The positions are chosen to avoid logs piling up on each other. Logs are injected in pairs of four (pair of three for the last three logs) starting from logs 1, 2, 3, and 4. The pairs are injected at different times to avoid overlap of logs which might have resulted in logs not being injected.

\subsection{Forces on RDDP}
Forces on RDDP due to impact of logs are measured for all six cases. Force magnitude and it's components are measured. A probability distribution function (PDF) of force is obtained for each case. While analyzing the forces on RDDP, unusually high forces were recorded of order of mega newtons. Acceleration due such high force was more than 1000g, where g is the gravitational acceleration. This is clearly not practical and is a result of numerical error in the computation. The reason maybe due default and recommended high DEM time scale parameter (time scale for calculating particle motion) of 0.2. With a high DEM time step, motion of the logs is not fully resolved and leads to higher acceleration of the logs. This results in a high force being calculated. These high forces have been filtered based on their acceleration. Different filters have been applied for different flow velocities. For $V = 0.5$ m/s, forces with acceleration greater than 1g are filtered. Forces greater than 1g in this case have a probability of nearly zero and thus are filtered. Since force (energy) is proportional to square of velocity, the filtering for higher velocities has been applied as a square of acceleration ratios. For $V = 1$ m/s, the filter is 4g and for $V = 2$ m/s, the filter is 16g. PDFs for each case are obtained after applying the filters. The PDFs are then compared to study the effect of log size and flow velocity on forces on RDDP.\\
\subsubsection{Effect of log size on forces on RDDP}
Effect of log size on forces on RDDP is studied. Two log sizes: 0.5L and 1L at three flow velocities are studied. Figure \ref{fig:RFSV0p5} shows the comparison of PDFs for force magnitude for different sizes when V = 0.5 m/s. As the size increases, the mean, median and max force increase. The probability of higher forces also increases with size. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{RFSize/V0p5_Size}
\caption{\label{fig:RFSV0p5}Comparison of PDFs of force magnitude for two sizes and V = 0.5 m/s.}
\end{figure} 

\noindent Figure \ref{fig:RFSV1p0} shows effect of size on forces on RDDP for V = 1 m/s. The behavior is different from the earlier V = 0.5 m/s cases because the logs are injected at different times for both sizes to avoid overlap. Logs do not interact at the same time in both cases. Number of logs impacting RDDP at any time is different in both cases. This causes the forces to be calculated at different times and the probability also changes. The median and max force increase with size but the variation is not large. Mean force is less for the higher size in this case. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{RFSize/V1p0_Size}
\caption{\label{fig:RFSV1p0}Comparison of PDFs of force magnitude for two sizes and V = 1.0 m/s.}
\end{figure} 

\noindent Figure \ref{fig:RFSV2p0} shows effect of size on forces on RDDP for V = 2 m/s. The distributions are very similar to each other. There is a slight variation between the mean, median and max forces. This is again due to different injection times for the two sizes. 

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{RFSize/V2p0_Size}
\caption{\label{fig:RFSV2p0}Comparison of PDFs of force magnitude for two sizes and V = 2.0 m/s.}
\end{figure} 

\noindent Figures \ref{fig:RFMeanForce_Size}, \ref{fig:RFMedianForce_Size}, and \ref{fig:RFMaxForce_Size} show variation of mean, median, and maximum of force magnitude with size for different velocities respectively. It can be seen that the behavior is not consistent. This is due to different injection times for each case. The variation of mean, median, and maximum of force magnitude is not large between the two sizes. It is safe to say that changing the lengths of the logs while maintaining the volume constant has little effect on the forces on RDDP.

\subsubsection{Effect of flow velocity on forces on RDDP}
Effect of three flow velocities on forces on RDDP  for two log sizes is studied. Flow velocities of 0.5 m/s, 1 m/s, and 2 m/s are used for this study.\\
Figure \ref{fig:RFSize0p5L_V} shows comparison of PDFs of force magnitudes for three velocities with log size 0.5L. As the flow velocity increases, the probability of larger forces increases. The mean, median, and maximum of force magnitude also increases. As the flow velocity increases, the momentum of logs increases, this increases the impact forces on RDDP. The probability of smaller forces increases as the flow velocity decreases. A similar behavior is seen for log size 1L as shown in Figure \ref{fig:RFSize1L_V}.

\noindent Figures \ref{fig:RDDP_MeanForce_V}, \ref{fig:RDDP_MeanForce_V}, and \ref{fig:RDDP_MeanForce_V} show variation of mean, median, and maximum of force magnitude with flow velocity for different log sizes respectively. As explained earlier, as the flow velocity increases, the momentum of logs increases and so does the impact force. The variation is quadratic as kinetic energy squares with velocity. The mean, median, and maximum force magnitude increase with increasing flow velocity for both log sizes.

\subsection{Forces on logs}
Forces calculated on logs include forces due to impact with RDDP and hydrodynamic forces. As before, the PDFs of force distribution are obtained for each log and compared to obtain effects of size and flow velocity effects on forces.

\subsubsection{Log1}
This is the log that is injected from location 1 as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Log_Positions}. This is inject along with logs 2, 3, and 4.\\ 
Figure \ref{fig:V0p5Log01_Size} shows comparison of PDFs of magnitude of forces for different log sizes at V = 0.5 m/s. Log1 of size 0.5L has higher probability of smaller  than mean forces than that of size 0.5L.  Probability of force being around the mean forces is higher for size 1L than size 0.5L. The variation of PDFs is because of different injection times. The amount of time any log interacts with RDDP is different for each case. This causes the PDFs to not follow any expected behavior.

For log of size 0.5L, probability of force being around the mean is high for V = 0.5 m/s. PDFs for V = 1 m/s and V = 2 m/s are similar but range of forces for V = 1 m/s is large. When the log impacts RDDP with flow velocity V = 2 m/s, the area in contact with RDDP is small compared to that in the case of V = 1 m/s. This is the reason, the range of forces is larger for V = 1m/s case. For log of size 1L, the variation is more consistent with that observed for other logs. As the velocity increases, the probability of high forces increases.

Maximum force increases with velocity for log of size 1L, while it increases at first for log of size 0.5L and then decreases. This is again due to the amount of area that is in contact with RDDP during the impact.

Figure \ref{fig:V0p5Log15_Size} shows comparison of PDFs of magnitude of forces for different log sizes at V = 0.5 m/s. Log15 of size 1L has higher probability of forces being around the mean than that for size 0.5L. Log of size 0.5L has higher probability of forces being large and small as well.

\subsection{Log positions and velocities}
Apart from measuring forces on RDDP and logs, position and velocities of logs are also calculated throughout the flow domain. Figure \ref{fig:V1p01LLog6_PositionX_ForceMag} shows position in flow direction and corresponding force magnitude on Log6 as a function of time for the case: V = 1 m/s and Size 1L. Figure \ref{fig:V1p01LLog6_PositionZ_ForceMag} shows the same information but the position is in cross flow direction. Using this information, the position of log when in contact with RDDP can be identified. This information can be further used to analyze how log interacts with the length of RDDP and which part of RDDP experiences maximum force that can cause structural damage or fatigue force that can cause fatigue failure. Figure \ref{fig:V1p01LLog6_VelocityMag_ForceMag} shows velocity magnitude and force magnitude as a function of time for the same case.

\subsection{Correlation between forces in flow direction and cross-flow direction}
While analyzing the forces on logs in the flow direction and the cross-flow direction, it was noted that there was a correlation between the forces in those directions. When the correlation coefficients were computed, it was noticed that it was positive for logs on the right side of RDDP (Log1, Log2, Log5, Log6, Log9, Log 10, and Log13) when viewed from top and negative for logs on the left side of RDDP (Log3, Log4, Log7, Log8, Log11, Log 12, and Log15). This means that for logs on the right side, when there is force in the positive x-direction (in the direction of flow) there is a force in the positive z-direction (cross-flow direction) and vice-versa. The fluid is pushing the logs forward and towards RDDP and RDDP is pushing the logs backwards and away from it. For logs on the left side this means that the flow is pushing the logs in the flow direction (positive x-direction) and towards RDDP (negative z-direction) while RDDP is pushing the logs backwards (negative x-direction) and away from it (positive z-direction). For Log14, the correlation coefficient is very small since it is a head on collision and the forces on both sides of the log in z-direction are fairly balanced.\\
Another interesting fact that was discovered from this analysis was that the slope of linear fit to the correlation points had a slope between 35 degrees and 42 degrees. There were some outliers in the data that were eliminated since they did not fit the correlation observations. These outliers are believed to be result of the numerical errors and need further investigation. What was interesting was the slope of the line in degrees was very close to the opening angle of RDDP (angle between the pontoons) which is 39 degrees. If the outliers are carefully eliminated, it is believed that the slope of the linear fit will be equal to the RDDP angle. This makes sense since the angle with respect to the x-direction at which the RDPD applies force on the log or the log applies force on the RDDP should be equal to the orientation or RDDP pontoons with x-direction. Figure \ref{fig:V1p0_1L_Log6} shows one example for correlation between the forces, the linear fit and it's slope. The data marked in red are the outliers in this case.
